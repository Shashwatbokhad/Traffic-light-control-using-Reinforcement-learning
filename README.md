# Traffic-light-control-using-Reinforcement-learning

In this reinforcement learning is used to optimize the flow of traffic at a four way junction. To create an env for our Q-Agent Open AI Gym is used
in the functions.py file env is created and this env is used in rlmodel.py to see the results in the simulation environment.

##########################################
the agent use traffic density as state and use change in traffic density at every cycle to give itself reward
